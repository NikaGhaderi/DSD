# Digital System Design

This repository contains the homework and projects I have completed during the Digital System Design (DSD) course in Spring 2024. All projects are implemented using Verilog.
Most projects have a corresponding report that describes its implementation. The project descriptions are available in the `report.pdf` file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder you're interested in.
3. Read the project report to understand the implementation details.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more details on each project.
If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.
